* Best viewed in Desktop browser
* Although it would still work in mobile browsers, it's not as intuitive (e.g. selecting text)

### TODO's
- [ ] Better placement of the comments (currently just stacking the comments 
- [ ] Better mobile browser support
- [ ] Add in more Rich Text Box features (e.g. Colors, Highlighting, Images)
